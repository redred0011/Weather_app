#Current Weather API

This is a Python script that retrieves current weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows you to get weather data by providing either the name of a location or its coordinates (latitude and longitude).

# Note

- The script uses the metric system to display temperature (in Celsius) and wind speed (in kilometers per hour).

- If an error occurs while fetching weather data or city name, please check the entered coordinates or location name.

- To stop the script, you can press `Ctrl + C`.
